How to deploy the application:

To deploy the application, the database must be accessible, the SQL script is stored in the install folder.

Once the database is up and running, the index.php file should be able to run the web pages through
the views folder.

The index.php contains the links to each page. These are the home, artists, and songs.

Each web page in the views folder has its content. The home.php contains the message and the summary of the active artists and songs
from the database.

The artists.php contains the summary as well as the active artists and the number of songs associated with them.

The songs.php also contains the summary. It also has the active artists, the songs associated with them as well as the duration
of each song.

The 404.php contains the summary but it will only show up if the user finds a page that does not exist in this application.
